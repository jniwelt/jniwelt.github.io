      How Could I Not Love You?
Your sense of tranquility but chaotic vibes are what make you important to the people of NYC. Not only do you provide a place for New Yorkers to reflect, you give them a place to be able to laugh, cry, smile, and be free. From your beautiful views to your trashed up corner, this is what makes New York City, New York City.
The view of the Williamsburg Bridge, the cold mist from the water and the sunset is what	makes East River such an amazing place to reflect. East River provides tasks for us to let out all of our emotions. When angry, you give us a path and a track to run on, when sad, you give us benches to cry on, when happy you give us grass to lie on, when playful, you give us fields to play on. You’ve watched it all happen. You’ve seen people at their worst and best moments. You’ve never left us hanging. You’ve never disappointed us. You’re a safe place for everyone and I see it daily. On my walks on the river I see people running, crying, sleeping, jumping. I too go to East River to let out my emotions. The day I spent crying at the river, I noticed a woman right next to me sitting and crying as well. I think it's a sign from East River telling me that I’m not alone. You're their safe place to let them be who they want to be, and do what they want to do. Although your water is green and filthy, you give us the cool breeze that hits our tears on a hard day. Even though your park is mostly filled with trash you give us something to let dogs out or let our little humans play. Always having clear skies and showing off the planes flying above and teasing us, making us wish we were in that plane. The beautiful green patches of nature where people bring blankets and let the beaming sun hit their face.  How could I not love you?
The two sides of the park. East and West. East side is more of a suburban spot. Perfect view of the bridge, baseball, soccer fields, and tracks. While the West side is more NYC. People sleeping on benches, the amphitheater where little kids always pretend they were pop stars, the family barbecues, big speakers blasting music while people dance and encourage strangers to join in. Though both sides are complete polar opposites, they share one thing in common. They bring people together. It brings the quiet people and the loud people together to test their comfort zones to try to become a whole. The quiet people who reflect and enjoy the view, move to the west side to dance and eat and try to become a big family. When the loud people who are always dancing and singing move to the east side for more control of their crazy life and to just enjoy life in silence.  You’ll find the same people, in the same spots, on the same day. How can you bring people together in this messed up world? New yorkers are known as being aggressive and careless. How come when they're with you it seems to go away? Is it all just an act? I don't think it is. You just provide a sense of belonging. A breath of fresh air from the stressful city. A place to relax for free. How could I not love you?
You give us memories that last a lifetime. You make me feel things that I’ve never felt before. You were my first true love. You were my home. You still are my home. You are a home to many others. You’re our guardian. You take care of us. You’ve never disappointed us even when we’ve let you down. There was a whole protest about you. We may not show it, but we love you. Hearing that you would be demolished, scared us. We thought we were going to lose the one thing that helped us feel okay. Helped us feel accepted when others didn’t. But you're spending 5 years of demolition to raise yourself up to protect us from another hurricane. You’re our guardian, always protecting us.
How could I not love you for all that you've done for me and others. You’re the only thing that stayed true in this fake world.
